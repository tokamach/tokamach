Software wise my interests are weird old programming languages like Lisp and Smalltalk, compilers, interpreters, and OS related topics. Lisp Machines, Plan 9, the Xerox Alto, and Emacs are my jam.

What I've been working on:  
- [My Literate Emacs config](https://github.com/tokamach/.emacs.d)
- [My Undergraduate dissertation project, a bare metal Lisp 'OS'](https://github.com/tokamach/beige)


What I've been reading:  
- [An APL Machine](https://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/slacreports/reports07/slac-r-114.pdf)
- [A Basis for a Mathematical Theory of Computation, McCarthy '63](https://ropas.snu.ac.kr/~kwang/4190.310/mccarthy63basis.pdf)
- [Alan Kay at OOPSLA '97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY)

I've been on a UX kick recently (in the Alan Kay/Douglas Englebart/Brett Victor school of things):
- [Peter Brett: Magic Ink](https://worrydream.com/MagicInk)
- [Man Computer Symbiosis, Licklider '60](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html)
